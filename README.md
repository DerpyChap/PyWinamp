winamp
======

Python Winamp controller originally made by [hugovk](https://github.com/hugovk/winamp). This lets you remotely control Winamp and pull various bits of info from it.

An example where this is used is in this [quick project](https://github.com/DerpyChap/Winamp-Discord-RPC) I did that reports your now playing song to Discord as a Rich Presence status.
